# Projects
A repository containing some of the projects that I have worked on.

The o2_sensor_code_linear_thingspeak.ino file contains the code I wrote for the device I designed for Lurie's Children Hospital.
This device was designed to record the oxygen concentration delivered to preterm infants and to send the data to the cloud.

The BMD307Lab4 files contain the code I wrote for an experiment meant to determine if there was a significant difference in reaction time
for subjects in response to visual stimuli versus auditory stimuli.
